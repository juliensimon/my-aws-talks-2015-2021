## Description
This passage introduces a common scenario in machine learning, where a developer trains a model locally using an open-source library and achieves promising results. It then describes the next logical step: deploying the model to a cloud environment hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to evaluate its performance in real-world conditions, enabling further experimentation with AB testing and other use cases.
