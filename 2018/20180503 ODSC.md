## Description
This document introduces Deep Learning for developers, focusing on activation functions, the Multiply and Accumulate process, and neural networks. It mentions that activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, which introduce non-linearity to the model. It also discusses the concept of neural networks as multi-layered graphs where neurons connect to process inputs and learn patterns from data. The source is cited as Wikipedia, which provides further technical details.
