# AWS Talks 2015-2021

Hey there! üëã I'm Julien Simon, and this is my personal collection of AWS presentations and talks from my time as a Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services.

From 2015 to 2021, I had the incredible opportunity to travel the world, meet amazing developers, and share the AWS story at hundreds of events - from massive re:Invent conferences to cozy local meetups. This repository is my way of preserving and sharing all those memories and knowledge.

## What's Inside

Think of this as my digital scrapbook of seven years in the cloud! üìö You'll find 332+ presentations covering everything from basic cloud concepts to cutting-edge AI/ML implementations. Each talk represents a moment in time, a conversation with developers, and a step in the incredible journey of cloud computing.

### The Journey Through Time

**2015-2016: The Foundation Years** üèóÔ∏è
- Back when "cloud" was still a buzzword and we were teaching the basics
- Security was everyone's biggest concern (still is!)
- Docker was the new kid on the block
- We were just starting to talk about "serverless"

**2017-2018: The AI Revolution Begins** ü§ñ
- SageMaker launched and changed everything
- Deep learning went from research labs to production
- We started seeing AI in unexpected places
- The edge computing story began to take shape

**2019-2020: Making AI Real** üéØ
- ML went from "cool demos" to "business value"
- AutoML made AI accessible to everyone
- Virtual events became the new normal
- We learned to teach ML without being in the same room

**2021: The Future is Now** üöÄ
- Open source models and AWS became best friends
- SageMaker got even more powerful
- We started talking about what comes next

## What You'll Find

- Shows how technology actually progresses over time

### For the Business Leader
- Digital transformation strategies that actually work
- Security lessons learned the hard way
- AI/ML adoption patterns from the trenches

## The Personal Touch

Each presentation has a story behind it:
- The late-night flights to make it to that meetup
- The amazing developers I met in cities around the world
- The questions that made me think differently
- The demos that worked (and the ones that didn't! üòÖ)

## File Formats

I've kept everything in two formats:
- **Markdown (.md)**: Easy to read, search, and learn from
- **PDF (.pdf)**: The original slides, exactly as I presented them

## My Hope for This Collection

I created this repository because I believe knowledge should be shared. Whether you're:
- A developer just starting your cloud journey
- A team lead looking for inspiration
- A student learning about technology evolution
- Someone curious about how we got from "what is the cloud?" to "AI for everyone"

...I hope you find something useful here.

## A Personal Note

These seven years were incredible. I got to witness the transformation of an industry, meet thousands of brilliant developers, and be part of something that changed how we build software. This collection is my way of saying "thank you" to everyone who attended those talks, asked those questions, and made this journey so rewarding.
